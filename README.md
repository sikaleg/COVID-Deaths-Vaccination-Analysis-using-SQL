# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using SQL (MySQL)
## Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQL (MySQL 8+).
The analysis explores COVID-19 infections, deaths, and vaccination trends across countries and continents.
It demonstrates data cleaning, aggregation, window functions, and views to create reusable datasets for analysis and visualization.

The focus of this project is on country-level insights while excluding aggregate regions such as continents and global totals.
